# Dark

### A game in which one escapes a mazeâ€”*in the dark*. 

> What is Dark about?

- Imagine that you've been trapped in a dark, dark room. Pitch black. You can hear a ticking noise. Somewhere in your heart, you know that you have to escape this room before the ticking noise runs out... 
- You'll just have to play the game if you want to know more. 

> Who can play Dark?

- ~Anyone.~ Actually, probably anyone over the age of 5. Children may find this game a little scary. 

> What's the story behind the creation of Dark?

- Games are the perfect type of project because one can start small and keep building. I always think of new features halfway through the project, so this will allow me to implement those features as I see fit. 
- I just really like escape rooms, and thought that the "escape" and time limit elements would create the perfect kind of pressure for the player. As for why it's set in the dark, I thought it would be too easy for the player if they had a full view of the layout. Also it's scarier that way.
